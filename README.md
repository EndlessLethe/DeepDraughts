To play with firends, just using following command:

## Supported Rule
Draughts in 8x8 board has mainly two rule: Russian and [Brazilian Rule](https://draughts.github.io/brazilian-checkers.html). Because Russian Rule is used more in international competitions, our project only completes Russian Rule for now.

```
game = Game(rule = RUSSIAN_RULE)
```

The command below can create a game using Brazilian Rule, but following one is not supported.
- In the situation where you have the choice between making multi-jumps over your opponentâ€™s checkers, it is mandatory to choose the one that make you capture the maximum pieces.

```
game = Game(rule = BRAZILIAN_RULE)
```
